The Sudoku Solver does not have an installer. To install it, download and unzip the SudokuSolver_2023_0.zip archive. Then copy the entire unzipped folder into your Program Files folder. Select the SudokuSolver.exe file and right click to create a desktop shortcut. The solver should run when you double click the shortcut icon.

To remove Soduku Solver from your computer, simply delete the SudokuSolver folder.

There is also a preferences file the SodukuSolver creates in:
\Users\*YourUserName*\AppData\Roaming\SDKUS\SDKUSprefs.dat
To remove it, delete the entire SDKUS subdirectory.
